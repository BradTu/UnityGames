## Pacific Pollution

Art and Code by Brad Tully

This game is supposed to be a statement on the pollution of our oceans. It starts with on a screen with a top down view of the ocean with trash floating. The player picks up as much as possible before the time runs out. The amount of trash determines how much trash will spawn in the second scene. The second scene is a runner where the player controls a turtle using the up and down arrows or 'W' and 'S', and tries to avoid eating trash. If the turtle eats 5 pieces of trash it dies and the game ends. As it eats trash it slows down. Also the trash is shown inside the turtles stomach in the bottom left corner of the screen.

## 4HourGameJam

Programming: Brad Tully, Jason Komoda, Joseph Yates

Scripts written by me:

https://github.com/BradTu/UnityGames/blob/master/4HourGameJam/Assets/Scripts/Enemy.cs

https://github.com/BradTu/UnityGames/blob/master/4HourGameJam/Assets/Scripts/ShootingEnemy.cs

https://github.com/BradTu/UnityGames/blob/master/4HourGameJam/Assets/Scripts/SpinningEnemy.cs

On this project I mainly wrote the scripts of the enemies and their behavior.

Other scripts written by Jason Komoda and Joseph Yates

For this game we were tasked to make a game where each team member could only put 4 hours of work into the game. We made a side scrolling space shooter. The goal is to stay alive until the boss fight. Also do not get hit by objects and do not let them hit the left side of the screen. 

Controls: WASD to move and left click on the screen to shoot rockets.

Enemies: The purple aliens can shoot you. The yellow aliens spin and can only be killed by shooting the cap of the spaceship. The asteroids take three shots to destroy them. The boss (eyeball) takes many shots to kill.

In GameController.cs wrote the "private IEnumerator hungerThirstTimer" starting at line 162

For this project I mainly did the behavior of the animals and the player controls.

Other scripts written by Jason Komoda and Joseph Yates

For this game we were tasked to make a game where each team member could contribute 8-12 hours of work. We made an apocalypse survival game where there is two weather modes. One where it is raining and there is a lot of water and resources. Then there is a drought. During the drought there is less resources and fires pop up that can hurt the player.

Deer attack the player if you get close which will decrease your health. Rabbits run away when you get close. You can kill both with your axe and collect meat to eat. You can knock down trees with your axe and collect the wood to make a new axe if yours breaks. When you walk over water you collect it and can drink it to satisfy your thirst. Every time the timer goes to 0 on the right. The thirst and hunger will decrease. If you have food and water it will increase your health. Once they reach 0 your health decreases. When your health is 0 the game ends.

Controls: WASD to move. Left click to use the axe. Left click the buttons on top to use resources.

## Ski Royale

Programming: Brad Tully, Jason Komoda, Joseph Yates

Art: Yitian Yie

For this game the work I did revolved around the Player movement/ controls, the game controller which manages the race scene, the grand prix, single race, time trial modes, the interactable objects, multiplayer, the tutorial scenes and scripts and the menus. I also made all of the race tracks.

Other things and scripts written by Jason Komoda and Joseph Yates

This game is a combat focused party racing game. The goal is to win the race. You can hit other players with your ski poles and you can use the various items to help you and hurt your foes. Certain items do damage, if you take too much damage you will die and will place poorly in the race. The game supports 1-4 splitscreen. In order to get the full experience of the game you MUST use XBOX controllers for the PC. Start the game on the "Menu" scene. Current game modes: Single Race, Grand Prix and Time Trial
