## Pacific Pollution

This game is supposed to be a statement on the pollution of our oceans. It starts with on a screen with a top down view of the ocean with trash floating. The player picks up as much as possible before the time runs out. The amount of trash determines how much trash will spawn in the second scene. The second scene is an "endless runner" where the player controls a turtle using the up and down arrows or 'W' and 'S', and tries to avoid eating trash. If the turtle eats 5 pieces of trash it dies and the game ends. As it eats trash it slows down. Also the trash is shown inside the turtles stomach in the bottom left corner of the screen.
